## Overview
This is a web application that generates a truth table given a boolean expression with any number of variables.

To "show work", it creates intermediary columns along the way for how it got the final column. That part was only written because I didn't like doing my homework freshman year in math. It uses an abstract syntax tree system to analyze the expression in order to find the steps, so it also supports removing duplicate expressions.
